Reflection:
This was really my first foray into coding. I only had experience in Python before this. However I was really glad I gave this project a shot. The challenge was definetly frusturating at times, but I geniunely enjoyed feeling like I was building something cool. I also learned alot, I spent the first few days after getting the project learning the syntax of javascript, react, node.js, how to build RESTful APIs, a lot of otherthings. I can't wait to continue learning these languages regardless of whether I am chosen for Change ++ or not. Shoutout to Code with Mosh, hes the goat fr.
